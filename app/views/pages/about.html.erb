	        	Homeroom creates a roster of students that can be grouped in different ways including by homeroom, by subgroup (e.g., low-income students), and by risk. The student risks are assigned according to a formula using MCAS and other assessments. Teachers and district administrators can use this roster to see patterns in their classrooms and identify specific interventions to support their students.
